# GAMCommandManager
A GUI for the GAM (Google Apps Manager) is used to administrate Google accounts on scale.

I made this PowerShell script because I found myself using GAM a lot but for smaller tasks, like delegating, or deleting classrooms. Instead of remembering or looking up the commands each time (although there are some great guides out there). I created a script that lists different menus and acts accordingly. 

I've made it so the script will work out of the box, but you will have to specify the location of your GAM install, as well as the server it is on each time if you don't hardcode it in. The options are at the top of the script and are marked, change these if you do not want to be asked where the install is each time. I like the idea of being able to run a script without having to remote into the server or open up a session hence it is built this way.

You are free to change and use the script how you wish, any traffic is of course appreciated. If you have any issues or suggestions please open up an issue.
